        "#Condition Monitoring with Exosite\n",
        "\n",
        "Building a condition monitoring solution with the Exosite IoT platform involves several key steps, including setting up an edge device, connecting sensor nodes, streaming data, and analyzing the collected data. Here's an introduction to each of these steps:\n",
        "\n",
        "Understanding Condition Monitoring:\n",
        "\n",
        "Condition monitoring involves continuously monitoring the operational parameters of machines or equipment to detect any deviations from normal operating conditions.\n",
        "By monitoring parameters such as vibration, temperature, noise, and other relevant factors, condition monitoring helps in predicting equipment failures, optimizing maintenance schedules, and improving overall equipment effectiveness (OEE).\n",
        "\n",
        "**Introduction to Exosite IoT Platform:**\n",
        "\n",
        "Exosite is an IoT platform that provides tools and services to connect, manage, and analyze IoT devices and data.\n",
        "It offers solutions for device management, data visualization, analytics, and integration with other systems.\n",
        "With Exosite, you can securely connect devices, collect data from sensors, visualize real-time and historical data, and perform advanced analytics to gain insights into your IoT deployments.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Setting Up an Edge Device:**\n",
        "\n",
        "An edge device serves as a gateway between sensors or devices and the cloud platform.\n",
        "It collects data from connected sensors, processes it locally, and then transmits the data to the cloud platform for further analysis.\n",
        "When setting up an edge device for condition monitoring, ensure it has the necessary connectivity options (such as Wi-Fi, Ethernet, or cellular) and computing capabilities to handle data processing tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Connecting Sensor Nodes:**\n",
        "\n",
        "Sensor nodes are devices equipped with sensors that measure various physical parameters.\n",
        "In a condition monitoring application for a pump, sensor nodes can measure parameters such as vibration, temperature, noise, and pressure.\n",
        "These sensor nodes are connected to the edge device, which aggregates data from multiple sensors and forwards it to the cloud platform.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Streaming and Analyzing Data:**\n",
        "\n",
        "Once sensor nodes are connected to the edge device, data is streamed to the Exosite IoT platform for analysis.\n",
        "The platform allows you to visualize real-time data streams, set up alerts for abnormal conditions, and perform advanced analytics to predict equipment failures or detect anomalies.\n",
        "By analyzing data such as noise levels from the pump, you can gain insights into its health, predict maintenance requirements, and optimize operational efficiency.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Application Areas and Benefits:**\n",
        "\n",
        "Condition monitoring solutions built with Exosite IoT platform can be applied across various industries, including manufacturing, energy, utilities, and transportation.\n",
        "Benefits include improved asset reliability, reduced downtime, optimized maintenance schedules, and increased operational efficiency.\n",

        "This script is designed to facilitate the setup of ExoEdge channels, which are used to collect data from various sources, such as sensors or external systems, and transmit it to the Exosite IoT platform. Here's a breakdown of what the code accomplishes:\n",
        "\n",
        "**JSON Configuration:** The script begins with a predefined JSON object (json_data) containing configuration settings for ExoEdge channels. Each channel is defined within the \"channels\" object, with properties such as description, display name, data type, and protocol configuration.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Parsing JSON:** The JSON data is parsed into a Python dictionary (data_dict) using the json.loads() function. This step allows for easy manipulation and access to the configuration settings within the script.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Accessing Configuration Settings:** The script demonstrates how to access specific configuration settings within the data_dict. For example, it prints the description of \"topic0\" and the port number of \"topic1\".\n",
        "\n",
        "**Explanation of Configuration Settings:** Finally, the script provides comments explaining the purpose of each configuration setting. It clarifies that each channel is associated with an MQTT broker subscription and describes the format of the MQTT topic field, including examples of topic configurations."
